        <h1>Raw data filtering - Scan filters</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This module comprises various filters that can be applied to the raw data
            scan by scan.

         <p>
            The preview shows the superposed spectra of the scan before and after the filter is applied.

        <h3>Mean filter</h3>
        <p>
            For each data point, the filter assigns to it the intensity average of all the datapoints inside the
            user defined window, which is centered in the mass value of this data point.

        <h3>Savitzky Golay filter</h3>

        <p>The Savitzky–Golay smoothing filter is a type of filter first described
            in 1964 by Abraham Savitzky and Marcel J. E. Golay.[1]</p>
        <p>
            The Savitzky–Golay method essentially performs a local polynomial regression (of degree k)
            on a series of values (of at least k+1 points which are treated as being equally spaced in the series)
            to determine the smoothed value for each point. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_smoothing_filter">

        <h4>Method parameters</h4>
        <dl>
            <dt>Number of datapoints</dt>
            <dd>This number can be 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 or 15. </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Crop filter</h3>
        <p>
            The scans out of the retention time range defined by the user are deleted
            by using this filter. Also, the data points of the remaining scans that are
            out of the m/z window defined by the user are deleted.
        </p>

        <h4>Method parameters</h4>
        <dl>
            <dt>m/z range</dt>
            <dd>m/z boundary of the cropped region.</dd>

            <dt>Retention time range</dt>
            <dd>Retention time boundary of the cropped region.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>m/z resample filter</h3>
        <p>
            Each scan is divide in m/z bins whose length is defined by the user in the
            parameters. The mass of the new data point will be in the middle of each
            m/z bin's space. Its intensity is the average of the intensity of all the
            data points inside the bin.
